# videocr â€“ Extract unique text from videos (macOS only)

![videocr in action](https://res.cloudinary.com/cpress/image/upload/w_1280,e_sharpen:60,q_auto/swpcciusugofqqvyiivs.jpg)

`videocr.py` uses macOS's native OCR to extract text from videos. This can then be perused or `grep`-ed for credentials, usernames, AWS access keys, or other personal data you may not want to be in a video you plan to share.
### USAGE

`python videocr.py in.mp4`
### REQUIREMENTS

Other than the Python packages in `requirements.txt`, you'll need:

* FFmpeg
* Python 3.10 or higher
* macOS Monterey or higher
### STATUS

This is only a rough proof of concept for now. I intend to have it automatically alert on specific, common token types, to tell you *where* in the video they appear, and to let you specify your own usernames and password fragments to search for.

If you wish to take this code and turn it into something more generally useful, be my guest, but if you reuse specific code from the project, then include the necessary copyright attribution as per `LICENSE`. Thank you.
#### NOTE REGARDING NAME

There is [another project called `videocr`](https://github.com/apm1467/videocr) which extracts hard-coded subtitles from videos. It's also written in Python but works cross-platform by using Tesseract (which I also tried, but it's just too slow). I may rename this project due to this, but as it's currently a prototype and the other videocr hasn't been updated in nearly three years, I'll let it sit for now.
